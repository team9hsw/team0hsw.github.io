<h1> Voltage in the Power Supply </h1> 
<hr> 
<p> Voltage is a very important thing for any electronic, although voltage works different in the power supply of a computer </p> 
<p> The way voltage works in a computer is different from most electrical appliances, due to the face that it converts AC power to DC power. </p>
