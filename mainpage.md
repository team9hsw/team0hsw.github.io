<h1> <b> Computer Power </b>  </h1> 
<body> 
<p> For challenge #2, "How Stuff Works", my group decided to take an approach that focuses on the power supply of a computer. </p>  
<br>
<p> This web page shall explain how the Power Supply powers a computer, and everything else behind the scenes of the power system. </p>
<hr> 
<h1> Power Supply </h1> 
<p> At its core, the power supply converts high voltage AC energy to low voltage DC energy. </p>
<p> Power supplys have a few different variants. These variants allow a computer to run/operate better depending upon the situation </p>
<p> Power supplies are often sorted by how much voltage they provide, such as the list below. </p>
<p> Some of the differnet variants of power supplies would be 
<ul>
<li> 3.3 volts </li>
<li> 5 volts </li> 
<li> 12 volts </li> 
</ul> 
</p>
<h1> Why does the power supply have to convert energy? </h1>
